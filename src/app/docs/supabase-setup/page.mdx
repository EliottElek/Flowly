# Self-Hosting Supabase Project with RLS

This guide walks you through the steps to self-host a Supabase project, including creating necessary tables and configuring Row-Level Security (RLS).

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Install Docker on your machine. [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
2. **Supabase CLI**: Install the Supabase CLI. [Get Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
3. **PostgreSQL Client**: Install a PostgreSQL client for manual database interaction.

---

## Steps to Self-Host

### 1. Initialize a Supabase Project
Run the following command to initialize your Supabase project:
```bash
supabase init
```

### 2. Start Supabase Locally
Start Supabase services:
```bash
supabase start
```

### 3. Connect to the Database
After starting, connect to your PostgreSQL database:
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `54322` (default for Supabase local setup)
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `postgres`

Use a PostgreSQL client or command-line tools:
```bash
psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres
```

## 4. SQL Scripts for Table Creation

Create the required tables using the following SQL scripts.

### Example Schema: Projects, Tasks, Comments

```sql
-- Table: organizations
CREATE TABLE public.organizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
-- Table: projects
CREATE TABLE public.projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    org_id UUID REFERENCES public.organizations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
-- Table: columns
CREATE TABLE public.columns (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID REFERENCES public.projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    index BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
-- Table: tasks
CREATE TABLE public.tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID REFERENCES public.projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    column_id UUID REFERENCES public.columns (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    priority TEXT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content JSONB,
    description TEXT,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES public.users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- Table: comments
CREATE TABLE public.comments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    task_id UUID REFERENCES public.tasks (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    project_id UUID REFERENCES public.projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    parent_id UUID REFERENCES public.comments (id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- Table: project_members
CREATE TABLE public.project_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID REFERENCES public.projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    role TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE TABLE public.organization_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    org_id UUID REFERENCES public.organizations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    role TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

## 5. SQL Scripts to Add RLS (Row Level Security)

### Enable RLS for Tables
Enable RLS for each table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.comments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.project_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Policies for `projects`

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete projects they own" on "public"."projects"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING ((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) = owner_id));

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert projects" on "public"."projects"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
TO authenticated

WITH CHECK ((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) = owner_id));

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update projects they own or are members" on "public"."projects"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) = owner_id) OR (( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) IN ( SELECT project_members.user_id
   FROM project_members
  WHERE (project_members.project_id = projects.id)))))
WITH CHECK (((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) = owner_id) OR (( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) IN ( SELECT project_members.user_id
   FROM project_members
  WHERE (project_members.project_id = projects.id)))));

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view projects they own or are members o" on "public"."projects"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) = owner_id) OR (( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) IN ( SELECT project_members.user_id
   FROM project_members
  WHERE (project_members.project_id = projects.id)))));
```

### Policies for `columns`

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to columns in accessible projects" on "public"."columns"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = columns.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = auth.uid())))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow delete from columns in accessible projects" on "public"."columns"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING ((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) IN ( SELECT project_members.user_id
   FROM project_members
  WHERE (project_members.project_id = columns.project_id))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow insert to columns in accessible projects" on "public"."columns"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
TO authenticated

WITH CHECK ((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) IN ( SELECT project_members.user_id
   FROM project_members
  WHERE (project_members.project_id = columns.project_id))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow update to columns in accessible projects" on "public"."columns"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING ((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) IN ( SELECT project_members.user_id
   FROM project_members
  WHERE (project_members.project_id = columns.project_id))))
WITH CHECK ((( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid) IN ( SELECT project_members.user_id
   FROM project_members
  WHERE (project_members.project_id = columns.project_id))));
```

### Policies for `tasks`

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to tasks in accessible projects" on "public"."tasks"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = tasks.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = ( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid))))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow delete from tasks in accessible projects" on "public"."tasks"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = tasks.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = ( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid))))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow insert to tasks in accessible projects" on "public"."tasks"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
TO authenticated

WITH CHECK ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = tasks.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = ( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid))))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow update to tasks in accessible projects" on "public"."tasks"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = tasks.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = ( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid))))))
WITH CHECK ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = tasks.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = ( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid))))));
```

### Policies for `comments`

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to comments in accessible tasks" on "public"."comments"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = comments.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = ( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid))))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow delete from comments in accessible tasks" on "public"."comments"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING ((user_id = auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Allow insert to comments in accessible tasks" on "public"."comments"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
TO authenticated

WITH CHECK ((EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM project_members
  WHERE ((project_members.project_id = comments.project_id) AND (project_members.user_id = ( SELECT auth.uid() AS uid))))));

CREATE POLICY "Allow update to comments in accessible tasks" on "public"."comments"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING ((user_id = auth.uid()))
WITH CHECK ((user_id = auth.uid()));
```
### Handle project creating trigger

```sql
-- Create the function to insert into project_members
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_project()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO project_members (project_id, user_id)
  VALUES (NEW.id, auth.uid()); -- auth.uid() gets the authenticated user's ID.
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Attach the trigger to the projects table
CREATE TRIGGER add_project_member
AFTER INSERT ON projects
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_project();
```

### Policies for `tags` deletion


```sql
ALTER TABLE task_tags
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_task
FOREIGN KEY (task_id)
REFERENCES tasks(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE task_tags
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tag
FOREIGN KEY (tag_id)
REFERENCES tags(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;

```

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_organization_member()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Insert into organization_members with the org_id of the project
    INSERT INTO organization_members (member_id, org_id)
    SELECT 
        NEW.member_id, 
        projects.org_id
    FROM projects
    WHERE projects.id = NEW.project_id;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Step 2: Create the trigger
CREATE TRIGGER project_members_trigger
AFTER INSERT ON project_members
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION add_organization_member();
```

## 6. Testing Policies

After applying these policies:
1. **Login** as an authenticated user.
2. Use the Supabase query editor or your app to test data access:
   - Ensure users can access only their allowed projects.
   - Test comment editing and deletion.

---

## 7. Deploying the Database

### Export SQL Schema
Once your schema and policies are ready, export them:
```bash
supabase db dump
```

### Apply the Schema to a Remote Database
To deploy the schema to a production database:
1. Copy the SQL dump to the server.
2. Apply it using `psql`:
   ```bash
   psql -h your-db-host -U your-db-user -d your-db-name -f path/to/dump.sql
   ```

---

## 8. Frontend Integration
Ensure your frontend queries align with the RLS rules:
- Use Supabase's client libraries.
- Authenticate users properly (e.g., JWT tokens).

---

## 9. Backup and Maintenance

- Schedule regular backups of your database.
- Test your RLS policies periodically.
